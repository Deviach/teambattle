# teambattle
Teambattle is a JC2 Multiplayer Mod game mode akin to Team Deathmatch. Before a round starts, players vote on which 'map' they would like to play, and are then taken to the specific team spawns, where they will battle it out to determine which team wins.

Teambattle uses a modified version of the buymenu script. If you would like to use the teambattle functionality, simply remove the buymenu scripts from client, server, and shared directories.
